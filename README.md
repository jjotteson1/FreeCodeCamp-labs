# FreeCodeCamp Labs

This repository contains all the labs Iâ€™ve completed from the [FreeCodeCamp Certified Full Stack Developer curriculum](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/full-stack-developer/).  
Each lab folder includes:
- My completed solution
- A README with the **lab description**, **user stories**, **tests**, and a **Live Demo** link
- An `index.html` file (and other files if needed) containing the solution
