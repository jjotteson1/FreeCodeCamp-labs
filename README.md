# FreeCodeCamp Labs

This repository contains all the labs Iâ€™ve completed from the FreeCodeCamp Certified Full Stack Developer curriculum.

Each lab folder includes:
- My completed solution
- A README with the lab description, user stories, tests, and a live demo link
- An `index.html` file (and other files if needed) containing the solution

You can view all the completed labs on the **[Live Site](./index.html)**.
